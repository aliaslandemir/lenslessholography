# Inline Holography Reconstruction

This project provides a PyQt-based GUI for reconstructing inline holography data. The application supports advanced phase retrieval, twin-image filtering, autofocus, and visualization tools.

## Features
- Angular Spectrum and Fresnel propagation methods.
- Iterative phase retrieval with positivity and finite support constraints.
- Adaptive thresholding during reconstruction.
- 3D deconvolution (placeholder Wiener filter).
- Twin-image suppression using Fourier domain filtering.
- Autofocus by maximizing phase range.
- Line profile comparisons for amplitude and phase.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyQt5
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
- scikit-image

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
